Domain Model - Cohort Manager 

The Cohort Manager should be able to support the following interactions

- Create a cohort with a cohort name
- Search for a cohort by cohort name
- Add student to a specific cohort
- Remove a cohort by cohort name
- Remove student from a specific cohort
- Return errors if student or cohort not found

A cohort should have a list of students. Each student should have a studentID, first name, last name, github username, email.
```
&&&&& CLASS  //  $$$$$ METHOD



&&&&& CohortManager() - Will hold all the methods related to the Cohort Manager methods

Properties -

cohorts = []
cohortCapacity = 24


DONE (But might change approach) $$$$$ createCohort(name) - This method will create new a new cohort and call it what we tell it to.

DONE $$$$$ findCohort(name) - This method will search all cohorts by name and return the match or an error if not found.

DONE $$$$$ removeCohort(name) - This will remove the cohort from the existing cohort list or return an error if not found.

EXT CRITERIA $$$$$ findStudent(id) - This will search all students by id and return the match or an error if not found

DONE $$$$$ createStudent(id, firstName, lastName, github username, email) - This will create the student



&&&&& Cohort() - Will hold all the methods related to searching for specifc students and specific student management

DONE $$$$$ addStudent(cohortName) - This method will add a student into an existing cohort and populate all the passed details or return an error if not found

$$$$$ removeStudent(id) - This will remove the student from the cohort they are in based on thier ID or return an error if not found.



&&&&& Student() - Will hold all the methods related to creating new students

properties -

studentId = id
firstName = firstName
lastName = lastName
github = github
email = email








#### Extended
```
- Search for student by student ID
- Cohorts have fixed capacity at 24 students. Adding students is not possible beyond the 24 limit.
- Cohorts can't have the same name, and can't exist without a name
- The same student can't exist in multiple cohorts.
- A student can't be removed from a cohort if it wasn't present in the first place.
- Search for students by name (first and last) and return all matching results

Your program should be composed of at least two classes
